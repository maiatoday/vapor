# Vapor

A simple desktop application built with Jetpack Compose for Desktop, showcasing a motley collection of graphic techniques to evoke a sense of anemoia for a non-existent time or place. A healthy mix of human-hand-crafted organic Kotlin and curated LLM augmented code snippets.

## Introduction‚Äî*do you understand* 

Vapor is a desktop application built with Jetpack Compose for Desktop. The application is a sample demonstration of
various graphic techniques in Compose. It pulls nostalgic visual aesthetics from the [Vaporwave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporwave)
meme/genre/music/aesthetic. It leans heavily on found elements and generated code and visuals. It
unashamedly pulls any visual technique to achieve a specific look. There will be üè∑Ô∏è ...

## Getting Started‚Äî*make a move*

To run the application locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or another IDE that supports Kotlin
3. Run the `main` function in `Main.kt`

Alternatively, you can run it in hot reload mode from the command line:

```
./gradlew runHot
```

## The hot reload experience‚Äî*time is running out*

1. Read about how to set up hot reload in the linked [How-To](howToAddHotReload.md).
2. Switch to the git tag at `start`
3. Run the project in hot reload mode with the command `./gradle runHot`
4. Switch to alternative project states by jumping to tags
5. See the final state by jumping to the `final` tag

## The full üéß experience‚Äî*it's all in your head*
