# Vapor

A simple desktop application built with Jetpack Compose for Desktop, showcasing a motley collection of graphic techniques to evoke a sense of anemoia for a non-existent time or place.  

## Introduction

Vapor is a desktop application built with Jetpack Compose for Desktop. The application is a sample demonstration of
various graphic techniques in Compose. It pulls nostalgic visual aesthetics from the Vaporwave
meme/genre/music/aesthetic. It leans heavily on anemoia or a longing for a place or time I have never experienced. It
unashamedly pulls any visual technique to achieve a specific look. There will be ...
- [ ] a triangle
- [ ] a minimum of one palm tree
- [ ] at least one dolphin
- [ ] retro tech pixelated if possible
- [ ] text slogans and japanese words
- [ ] glitches
- [ ] mesh pastel gradients
- [ ] a sunset
- [ ] vanishing floor tiles
- [ ] more glitches
- [ ] a marble bust

## Getting Started

To run the application locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or another IDE that supports Kotlin
3. Run the `main` function in `Main.kt`

Alternatively, you can run it in hot reload mode from the command line:

```
./gradlew runHot
```

## The hot reload experience

1. Learn how to set up hot reload in the linked [How-To](howToAddHotReload.md).
2. Switch to the git tag at `start`
3. Run the project in hot reload mode with the command `./gradle runHot`
4. Switch to subsequent project states by jumping to tags
