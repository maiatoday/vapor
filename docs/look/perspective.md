**Algorithm:**
1. **Define Canvas and Viewport:**
    - Establish the boundaries of your drawing area (canvas).
    - Define a viewport within the canvas. This is where the perspective projection will be visible.

2. **Set Vanishing Point:**
    - Choose the coordinates (xvp, yvp) of your vanishing point. This point represents infinity in the perspective projection. It's where all lines that are parallel in the real world converge. The vanishing point can be anywhere within or outside the viewport.

3. **Define Ground Plane Grid:**
    - Imagine a grid on the ground plane (think of a checkerboard). You need to define the parameters of this grid:
        - `x_start`, `x_end`: The starting and ending x-coordinates of the grid.
        - `z_start`, `z_end`: The starting and ending z-coordinates (depth) of the grid.
        - `x_spacing`: The distance between grid lines along the x-axis.
        - `z_spacing`: The distance between grid lines along the z-axis. (Note: I'm using 'z' here to represent depth, as is common in 3D graphics).

4. **Project Grid Lines:**
    - **X-axis lines (lines parallel to the x-axis):**
        - Iterate through the z-coordinates of the grid lines (from `z_start` to `z_end` with a step of `z_spacing`). For each z-coordinate:
            - Find two points: (`x_start`, `z`) and (`x_end`, `z`). These are the endpoints of a grid line in 3D space.
            - Project each of these 3D points onto the 2D canvas using the perspective projection formula (explained below).
            - Draw a line between the two projected 2D points.

    - **Z-axis lines (lines parallel to the z-axis):**
        - Iterate through the x-coordinates of the grid lines (from `x_start` to `x_end` with a step of `x_spacing`). For each x-coordinate:
            - Find two points: (`x`, `z_start`) and (`x`, `z_end`).
            - Project each of these 3D points onto the 2D canvas.
            - Draw a line between the two projected 2D points.

5. **Perspective Projection Formula:**
   The core of the algorithm is the perspective projection. Here's the formula:
    - Let (x, z) be a point on the ground plane in 3D space (we're treating y as constant and 0, since it's a flat grid). We want to project this to (x', y') on the 2D canvas.
    - Let (xvp, yvp) be the coordinates of the vanishing point.
    - Let `d` be the distance from the camera to the image plane (focal length). This controls the amount of perspective distortion. A smaller `d` results in more extreme perspective.
``` 
    x' = x_vp + (x - x_vp) * (d / (z + d))
    y' = y_vp + (0 - y_vp) * (d / (z + d))   // y is always 0 in our grid.
```
*   **Explanation:** The `d / (z + d)` term is the scaling factor that causes the perspective foreshortening. As `z` increases (further away from the camera), this factor gets smaller, causing objects to appear smaller.
